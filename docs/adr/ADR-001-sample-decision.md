# ADR-001: TypeScript Migration for Type Safety

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AI-Powered Recruiter Automation project started as a JavaScript codebase but has grown in complexity with multiple API endpoints, data models, and integration points. The lack of type safety was leading to runtime errors and making refactoring difficult.

## Decision

We will migrate the entire codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript to improve type safety, developer experience, and code maintainability.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Improved Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation
- **Easier Refactoring**: Confident changes with type checking
- **Better Team Onboarding**: Clear interfaces and contracts

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn TypeScript
- **Build Complexity**: Additional compilation step
- **Migration Effort**: One-time cost to convert existing code
- **Bundle Size**: Slightly larger bundle due to type information

## Implementation Notes

- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- [x] Install TypeScript dependencies
- [x] Convert server-side code to TypeScript
- [x] Add type definitions for external libraries
- [x] Update build process to compile TypeScript
- [x] Update CI/CD pipeline for TypeScript
- [x] Add type checking to pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Convert client-side JavaScript to TypeScript
- [ ] Add comprehensive type definitions for all APIs

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Server-side migration (completed)
2. **Phase 2**: Client-side migration (in progress)
3. **Phase 3**: API type definitions (planned)
4. **Phase 4**: Full type coverage (planned)

## Rollback Plan

- Keep JavaScript files as backup during migration
- Use `allowJs: true` in TypeScript config for gradual migration
- Can revert to JavaScript if critical issues arise

## Testing Requirements

- All existing tests must pass after TypeScript conversion
- Add type checking to CI pipeline
- Ensure no runtime behavior changes
