# ADR-001: TypeScript Migration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project started with vanilla JavaScript but has grown in complexity. We need better type safety, improved developer experience, and better tooling support for refactoring and maintenance.

## Decision
Migrate the entire codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better type safety and fewer runtime errors
- Improved IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
- Better documentation through types
- Easier to maintain and refactor code
- Better integration with modern tooling

### Negative
- Initial migration effort required
- Learning curve for team members new to TypeScript
- Slightly more verbose code
- Build process complexity increased

## Implementation Notes
- Timeline: 2 weeks for migration
- Migration strategy: Gradual migration with `allowJs: true`
- Rollback plan: Keep JavaScript files as backup
- Success metrics: Zero type errors, improved developer productivity
