# RFC-000: RFC Template

## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented
- Corner cases are dissected by example

The section should return to the examples given in the motivation section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity
- Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- The impact on teaching people this feature
- Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- Cost of migrating existing code (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved Questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?

## Implementation Notes

- [ ] Implementation steps
- [ ] Migration strategy
- [ ] Testing requirements
- [ ] Documentation updates
